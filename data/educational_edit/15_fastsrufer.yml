title: "FastSurfer - a fast and accurate deep-learning based neuroimaging pipeline"
abstract: "The rapid emergence of standardized robust non-invasive imaging methods and infrastructure for big data analysis has promoted the advent of a variety of large-scale neuroimaging studies. As a central component, versatile MR imaging offers the potential to investigate in-vivo the variability, development and anatomical layout of the human brain in health and disease. Increasing our knowledge of pre-symptomatic neuroanatomical changes supports research into disease etiology, risk and preserving factors, as well as potential intervention paradigms. Consequently, there is a need for efficient, scalable, and sensitive software tools to automatically extract clinically-relevant imaging markers. Traditional neuroimage analysis pipelines, however, often involve computationally intensive, time-consuming optimization steps, and thus, do not scale well to large cohort studies."
