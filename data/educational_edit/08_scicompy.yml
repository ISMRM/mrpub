title: "Scientific computing with Python"
abstract: " This interactive Jupyter Book is comprised of 3 notebooks, outlining an overarching standard operating procedure to work with 1D ( audio files of MRI pulse sequences, guitar melodies and vocal tracks), 2D (BIDS formatted reconstructed images) and 3D (multi-channel k-space data in ISMRM-RD format) data: i) obtain meta-information about the data and use community-developed readers wherever possible, ii) use NumPy to prepare the data for further processing and iii) use Scipy modules to perform fundamental signal and image processing tasks."
