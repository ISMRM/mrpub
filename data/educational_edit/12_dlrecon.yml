title: "Deep learning reconstruction"
abstract: "The repository hosts some example codes to perform MR image reconstruction with deep learning architectures. We showcase a comparison of denoising networks (denoising) and unrolled reconstruction networks (physics-based). Pure real-valued processing (real) is compared against complex-valued processing as complex-valued operations (complex) or 2-channel real-valued operations (2chreal). Respective complex-valued operations and data consistency layers are provided. A deep plug-and-play prior example is illustrated for cardiovascular MRI."
