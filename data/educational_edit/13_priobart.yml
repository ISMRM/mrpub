title: "Using data-driven image priors for image reconstruction with BART"
abstract: "Advanced reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning have recently drawn a lot of interest as they tend to outperform state-of-the-art methods. BART is a versatile framework for image reconstruction. In this work, we demonstrate how neural networks trained and tested with TensorFlow [5] can be integrated into BART. As an example, we discuss non-Cartesian parallel imaging using the SENSE model regularized by a log-likelihood image prior. The image prior is based on an autoregressive generative network pixel-cnn++. Furthermore, we validated the reconstruction pipeline using radial brain scans."
