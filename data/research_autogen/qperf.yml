abstract: Quantitative myocardial perfusion mapping has advantages over qualitative
  assessment, including the ability to detect global flow reduction. However, it is
  not clinically available and remains a research tool. Building upon the previously
  described imaging sequence, this study presents algorithm and implementation of
  an automated solution for inline perfusion flow mapping with step by step performance
  characterization.
