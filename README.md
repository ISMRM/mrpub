To test it locally, you will need to:
1. Clone/fork this GitHub repo: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ismrm/mrpub`
2. If [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is not installed, follow the steps in their documentation to install it on your machine: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/
3. To run the website locally, make sure you are still in `mrpub/` dir and type `hugo serve -D`.
   - The -D option is to serve the website including the draft .md files.
