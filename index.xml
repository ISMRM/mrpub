Neurolibre welcome submissions along two tracks of neuroscience-related material: (1) tutorials, (2) paper companions. Prior to review, an editor establishes that the submission qualifies in principles, and an administrator has made the resource available for the neurolibre binder, so you can review the material directly on our portal (the link is at the top of the README.</description></item><item><title>example post</title><link>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2017/11/29/example-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2017/11/29/example-post/</guid><description>Populate card based on yaml file put in /data.</description></item><item><title>A Plain Markdown Post</title><link>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 21:49:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</guid><description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description></item><item><title>Lorem Ipsum</title><link>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2015/01/01/lorem-ipsum/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 13:09:13 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/2015/01/01/lorem-ipsum/</guid><description>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

NeuroLibre currently welcomes submissions along two tracks:
Tutorial notebooks related to a workshop in the neuroscience field. Companion notebooks for articles posted as preprints in the neuroscience field. These notebooks are expected to use less than 100 GB disk space, and run in less of an hour, although exceptions may be granted on a case by case basis. Each user has 1CPU (up to 2 depending on the server workload) and 4GB RAM (up to 6GB depending on the server workload), so your notebooks should be able to run under this configuration.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/mrhub/publications/</guid><description>Now UI Kit.
